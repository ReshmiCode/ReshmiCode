## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­  Intro: I am Reshmi Ranjith, a Masters student going to the University of Texas at Dallas. I came across my passion for Computer Science accidentally, and since then I have been pursuing many different opportunities to explore the field.
<br/> âš¡ Fun fact: In my free time, I like doing crafts! I started diamond painting over quarantine.

## Today I Learned

Since quarantine started, I have had extra time. I started making Today I Learned posts to motivate and document something new I learn each day. Eventually, I'll make my own website but for now here's the past 5 posts:

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->[&lt;p&gt;Today I learned that you can make classes private in Dart by adding an underscore to the front of it&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;](https://simplyprogramming.tumblr.com/post/688501710196473856)[&lt;p&gt;Today I learned about how to use named arguments in Dart. It reminds me of object properties from Javascript but itâ€™s interesting how they become not required and help the code be more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create named arguments in a constructor: Person&lpar;{this.name}&rpar;;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create positional arguments in a constructor: Person&lpar;this.name&rpar;;&lt;/p&gt;](https://simplyprogramming.tumblr.com/post/688410852274143233)[&lt;p&gt;Today I started learning Flutter as I have free time over the summer. I learned that Flutter doesnâ€™t use any native platform specific elements but has elements of its own which is a bit different from React Native.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;](https://simplyprogramming.tumblr.com/post/686871122356191232)[&lt;p&gt;Today I learned about the different annotations beans can have and what they mean. Repository is for storage/retrieval/search from a database, Service is for business logic, Controller is from the MVC pattern, and Component is just a generic component.&lt;/p&gt;](https://simplyprogramming.tumblr.com/post/661958123846844416)[&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™m learning Java Spring for my new job and today I learned you can define beans as either singleton or prototype. Singleton means only a single instance of the bean will be made even if queried multiple times from the context while prototype means a new one will be made.&lt;/p&gt;](https://simplyprogramming.tumblr.com/post/661317186515877888)<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:END -->
