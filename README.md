## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­  Intro: I am Reshmi Ranjith, a Masters student going to the University of Texas at Dallas. I came across my passion for Computer Science accidentally, and since then I have been pursuing many different opportunities to explore the field.
<br/> âš¡ Fun fact: In my free time, I like doing crafts! I started diamond painting over quarantine.
